Safely scan and convert WordPress database tables to utf8mb4 for 4-byte character support, including emojis and multilingual Unicode characters.

== Description ==

LightMoving UTF8MB4 Converter helps modernize older WordPress databases that still use latin1, utf8, or other non-utf8mb4 collations.

The plugin scans your WordPress database tables, identifies tables that are not using utf8mb4, and provides a safe administrator-controlled conversion workflow.

Features include:

* Database charset and collation scan
* WordPress table scan using the active table prefix
* utf8mb4 server capability detection
* Backup confirmation workflow
* Required CONVERT confirmation step
* Individual WordPress table conversion
* Clean conversion success logging
* Responsive modern admin interface
* Direct Tools link from the Plugins page
* No automatic conversion on activation

This utility is especially useful for:

* older WordPress sites
* migrated websites
* legacy hosting environments
* Themify and older builder installs
* emoji and 4-byte character support warnings
* multilingual WordPress environments

== Safety Features ==

* No automatic conversion on plugin activation
* Administrator-only access
* Backup confirmation checkbox
* Required CONVERT confirmation text
* Converts only tables using the active WordPress table prefix
* Displays current database charset and collation
* Displays current table engine and collation
* Converts database default charset/collation
* Converts WordPress tables individually

== Important ==

Always create a complete database backup before converting database tables.

Large tables may require additional time depending on hosting resources. Conversion operations may temporarily lock tables while MySQL or MariaDB processes ALTER TABLE operations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to Tools → LightMoving UTF8MB4 Converter
4. Review your database and table status
5. Create a full database backup
6. Confirm and run the conversion

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this run automatically? =

No. The plugin never converts database tables automatically on activation.

= Does this support emojis? =

Yes. utf8mb4 adds support for 4-byte Unicode characters including emojis.

= Will this convert all tables? =

The plugin converts WordPress tables using the currently active WordPress table prefix.

= Should I create a backup first? =

Yes. Always create a complete database backup before running database conversion operations.
